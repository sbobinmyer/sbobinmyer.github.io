	<p> <h1>Freedom Art</h1>

	Freedom art is a place where people can go and learn the basics of art. You will learn how to shade properly, paint, and what colors look good with what. It is a place where there are no boundaries on what can and can't do. Freedom art will not tolerate staff being rude or judgemental to our customers and their art. There will be rules in place that tell people that they can't do certain things like braking colored pencils in half or don't throw paint. Common courtesy rules are what we will call them so they don't seem like if you break the rules you will get thrown out immediately. There will be astrike system in place that 5 or more strikes there will be a suspension of 4 days and if you get 10 strikes you will not be aloud back for 3 months and do not get a refund of money for those months.

I came up with this idea because as a kid I always wanted a place I could go to and just hang out and meet new people and learn how to draw, paint and express myself. As a customer you will be taken care of no matter what there will be snacks you could order and drinks that will be able to be ordered. I think that most of my customers will be kids. There will be places that our customers can go to and think while they are painting. If the person doesn't finish the work of art that day they can leave it as long as it has their name on it and no one will touch it except for the person working on it and maybe the staff. It will meet the customers need by letting them have the freedom some places won't allow them to have in doing art.

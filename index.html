	<p> <h1>Freedom Art</h1>

	Freedom art is a place where people can go and learn the basics of art. You will learn how to shade properly, paint, and what colors look good with what. It is a place where there are no boundaries on what can and can't do. Freedom art will not tolerate staff being rude or judgemental to our customers and their art. There will be rules in place that tell people that they can't do certain things like braking colored pencils in half or don't throw paint. Common courtesy rules are what we will call them so they don't seem like if you break the rules you will get thrown out immediately. There will be astrike system in place that 5 or more strikes there will be a suspension of 4 days and if you get 10 strikes you will not be aloud back for 3 months and do not get a refund of money for those months.

I came up with this idea because as a kid I always wanted a place I could go to and just hang out and meet new people and learn how to draw, paint and express myself. As a customer you will be taken care of no matter what there will be snacks you could order and drinks that will be able to be ordered. I think that most of my customers will be kids. There will be places that our customers can go to and think while they are painting. If the person doesn't finish the work of art that day they can leave it as long as it has their name on it and no one will touch it except for the person working on it and maybe the staff. It will meet the customers need by letting them have the freedom some places won't allow them to have in doing art.

Giancarlo Inocencio says yes he would buy the pass as long as he can make whatever he wants and go and work whenever he wanted. Jamie clark say she would buy the pass as long as she can paint outside even if it's windy. She also mentioned that there should be more rules so people cant vandalize the building. Lilyan Franklin said she loves painting and would love to buy this pass because she is homeschooled and gets bored easily, so this will give her something to do besides work. She also said that it would be nice if there were lockers for sale as well as the pass. Jigger dhilon said he wouldn't buy the pass only because he doesnt wanna be made fun of for messing up with painting. He said that there should be away to judge or score a persons art so they can win a prize or something else that the person might want. Madison said she would buy the pass because she likes making crafts. She also said that it seems super safe when it comes to protecting the art so no one can mess with your art.

This product differs from other places because it is a place that you can go to and test your limits as an artist. You can go to see other people work to get inspired it is a place that anyone of any age can go to and create as much art as they want. Instead of going to a place that has a classroom environment that teaches you how to  make one thing you could come to freedom art and learn how to do a lot of different types of art and not have to cram all of one sittings worth of art class in you can spread it out for a few days.

A short term goal is to have this plan done by the end of the semester in its full have all the numbers ran have a place to set up ready and have my first customers planned out. I will need to find the building that would work the best for my business.  A mid term goal I have is to have all my debt if i need loans to be completely paid off. I can do this by saving money for a few years before starting my business so I don't have to use any loans.  My long term goal is to be able to make enough money to retire off of this one business and not have to work for anyone my entire life, and have a family that lives off of how much I make working at freedom art. I can also make a lot of money by saving money instead of going and blowing through all my money. I could also invest a little money in stocks.

This product differs from other places because it is a place that you can go to and test your limits as an artist. You can go to see other people work to get inspired it is a place that anyone of any age can go to and create as much art as they want. Instead of going to a place that has a classroom environment that teaches you how to  make one thing you could come to freedom art and learn how to do a lot of different types of art and not have to cram all of one sittings worth of art class in you can spread it out for a few days.

A short term goal is to have this plan done by the end of the semester in its full have all the numbers ran have a place to set up ready and have my first customers planned out. I will need to find the building that would work the best for my business.  A mid term goal I have is to have all my debt if i need loans to be completely paid off. I can do this by saving money for a few years before starting my business so I don't have to use any loans.  My long term goal is to be able to make enough money to retire off of this one business and not have to work for anyone my entire life, and have a family that lives off of how much I make working at freedom art. I can also make a lot of money by saving money instead of going and blowing through all my money. I could also invest a little money in stocks.

This product differs from other places because it is a place that you can go to and test your limits as an artist. You can go to see other people work to get inspired it is a place that anyone of any age can go to and create as much art as they want. Instead of going to a place that has a classroom environment that teaches you how to  make one thing you could come to freedom art and learn how to do a lot of different types of art and not have to cram all of one sittings worth of art class in you can spread it out for a few days.

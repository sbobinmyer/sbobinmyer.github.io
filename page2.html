Giancarlo Inocencio says yes he would buy the pass as long as he can make whatever he wants and go and work whenever he wanted. Jamie clark say she would buy the pass as long as she can paint outside even if it's windy. She also mentioned that there should be more rules so people cant vandalize the building. Lilyan Franklin said she loves painting and would love to buy this pass because she is homeschooled and gets bored easily, so this will give her something to do besides work. She also said that it would be nice if there were lockers for sale as well as the pass. Jigger dhilon said he wouldn't buy the pass only because he doesnt wanna be made fun of for messing up with painting. He said that there should be away to judge or score a persons art so they can win a prize or something else that the person might want.

This product differs from other places because it is a place that you can go to and test your limits as an artist. You can go to see other people work to get inspired it is a place that anyone of any age can go to and create as much art as they want. Instead of going to a place that has a classroom environment that teaches you how to  make one thing you could come to freedom art and learn how to do a lot of different types of art and not have to cram all of one sittings worth of art class in you can spread it out for a few days.
